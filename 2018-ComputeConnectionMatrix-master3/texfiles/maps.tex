\section{Conley Theory for Discrete Dynamical Systems}\label{sec:maps}

The Conley theory for discete dynamical systems as been developed by Robbin and Salamon and Franks and Richeson.

In the case of a discrete dynamical system $f:X\to X$ the appropriate notion is to have a 


\subsection{Preliminaries}
If $C$ is a category we may define a new category ${\bf End}(C)$ as follows: the objects of ${\bf End}(C)$ are pairs $(A,a)$ where $A$ is an object of $C$ and $a\colon A\to A$ is a morphism of $C$.  A morphism of $\psi\colon (A,a)\to (B,b)$ of $C$ is a morphism $\psi\colon A\to B$ such that $\psi\circ a = b\circ \psi$.

\begin{ex}
Consider ${\bf Ch}(k)$.  $End(Ch(k))$.
\end{ex}



\subsection{Endomorphisms of Chains}


An object in ${\bf End}(\bCF)$ is a pair $(f,\phi)$ with $f\colon \sL\to Sub(C,d)$ and $F\colon C\to C$ with 
\[
F(f(q))\subseteq f(q)
\]
